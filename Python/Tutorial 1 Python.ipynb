    "Each notebook has a single state that is shared between all cells which is where code is executed, the **kernel**. In other words, a kernel's state persists over time. Whenever you execute a cell, it modifies that state by running functions and setting variable values. This means that we can import a Python package, define a function, or create an object in one cell and, after being executed, we can reference the package, function, or object in any other cell. This is the case regardless of the order of cells in your notebook - the important thing is the *order in which the cells were exectuted in the kernel* (which is where our handy input label can help us keep track). Usually, the cells of a notebook should be executed top-to-bottom, but that order has no influence on the program state: only the order of executions does!"
